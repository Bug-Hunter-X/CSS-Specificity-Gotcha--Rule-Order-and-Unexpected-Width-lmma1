The solution involves reorganizing the CSS rules to ensure that the most specific selector is always the last one that is processed:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#myId .container {
  width: 200px;
}

.container.myClass {
  width: 300px;
}

#myId .container.myClass {
  width: 100px;
}
```

By ordering the rules from least to most specific, the cascade works predictably.  This is a best practice for CSS authoring to avoid confusing behavior.
